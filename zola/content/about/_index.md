Hey, I'm Jakub Kopecky, known as mq37. I'm passionate about:
- **software engineering**: Python, Svelte, Nix(OS), tinkering with dotnet C#, avid to learn Rust and it's amazing OCaml inspired type system
- **cyber security**: done a few CTFs and really enjoyed them, basic reverse engineering, participated in national cyber security competition
- **server stuff**: this site runs on NixOS with simple mail server, also have a few RPIs
- **artificial intelligence**: tinkered with GANs few years ago and now with Stable Diffusion, my favorite algo is KNN for it's simplicity
- **solution architecture**: enjoy designing a solution while keeping it simple


I'm currently studying Applied Informatics at [Faculty of Informatics, UJEP](https://ujep.cz) university while also working as a software engineer. In my spare time I like to tinker around, work on my side projects, learn new stuff and hit the gym. On this site I would like to share interesting stuff and solved issues that could help someone in future.
